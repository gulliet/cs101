	If you've ever wanted to see what a cross between an iPad and a Kinect would result in, <a href="http://crunchylogistics.com/padzilla-too-interactive-case-the-largest-ipad-ever-using-gesture-recognition/">Crunchy Logistics just unveiled its Padzilla Too video display</a> that utilizes both. The bound-to-be pricey display projects what Crunchy Logistics claims is the largest reproduction of the iPad in the world onto a wall. The 24-feet wide and 12-feet tall iPad screen, constructed with 3.5mm LED wall matrix display technology, can be controlled by Kinect gestures.</p>

<p>
	One advantage to iCloud is <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/03/09/digital-copy-videos-now-available-via-icloud/">the ability to re-download movies</a> that you purchased through iTunes. When the download feature became available in March, only four of the six major movie studios were on-board with the service. The two holdouts, Universal and 20th Century Fox, had contracts with HBO that prevented their participation in the service.</p>
<p>
	HBO reportedly loosened its agreement and now Universal movies are available for download via iCloud, according to <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/04/07/universal-studios-movies-now-available-on-icloud/">a MacRumors report</a>. Movies from 20th Century Fox are still not available in iCloud, but negotiations supposedly are under way and iCloud support should be coming soon.</p>

<p>
	I have been through sooooo many iPad cases and stands. Cases with keyboards, cases without, backpack cases, mini-briefcase models, you name it, I've tried it. Since I work at home, my needs aren't that complicated. I need something that serves as a stand, won't tip over, and allows me to adjust the angle of my iPad to taste.</p>
<p>
	The good folks at <a href="http://www.paddedspaces.com/">Padded Spaces</a> sent me the Prop 'n Go Slim tablet stand and I'm hooked. I <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/04/18/taking-a-stand-on-ipad-stands/">reviewed the original Prop 'n Go case</a> almost a year ago, and found it nice to use, but way too thick. I then <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/01/a-unique-ipad-stand-for-around-the-house-and-travel/">tried a slimmer case</a> from Padded Spaces last year, and while very well constructed, I thought it was too thick as well. I did like the fact that it was narrower.</p>
<p>
	I think this new slim model hits the sweet spot. It's not a case, so I'll use something else for protecting the iPad when I travel. The Slim is US $35, has 14 adjustable angles, and works with iPads, the Kindle and I would think most Android tablets too. The dimensions work with the iPad in either landscape or portrait orientation. The base is flat, rather than wedge shaped, which is an improvement I suggested in my review last year. The Prop 'n Go works very well on a bed or soft couch. It comes in blue or black, and it is very solid, the iPad doesn't move even if I'm tapping and sliding across the screen with some force. The only negative is the iPad is not anchored to the tablet, so if you carry it around the house, you need to hold it upright. Although the surface is made from non-slip materials, you want to be careful the stand and your iPad aren't headed in different directions.</p>
<p>
	This latest Prop 'n Go is the perfect stand for me. It's very well made, won't tip over, and for my uses is nearly perfect. I'm told supplies are a bit constrained until next week, but I think this stand is worth the wait.</p>
<p>
	You can compare the original design to the slim in the gallery below.</p>

<p>
	The New York Times ran a report over the weekend that claimed Tim Cook was a million-dollar-a-day CEO. Acording to <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/04/08/apple-ceos-earnings-the-new-york-times-gets-it-wrong/">a follow-up report from CNN Money</a>, that estimate is way off.</p>
<p>
	The CNN report claims the NYT was correct with the CEO's yearly salary of US$900,000, but made a mistake when it included the one million shares of Apple stock that Cook was granted in 2011. These shares won't vest for ten years, which means Cook won't see any of that money until 2021.</p>
<p>
	CNN Money took the value of those shares ($376.2 million on the day they were granted) and calculated that Cook would get $103,000 a day over the ten-year period. When you combine the stock money with Cook's salary, the resulting figure is not even close to the $1 million the NYT claims.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/09/cnn-money-new-york-times-gets-tim-cooks-earnings-wrong/">CNN Money: New York Times gets Tim Cook's earnings wrong</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Mon, 09 Apr 2012 15:00:00 EST.

	Former Apple Genius Stephen Hackett recounted his years working at an Apple Store in his recent book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bartending-Memoirs-Apple-Genius-ebook/dp/B007RPJMFK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1333994895&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Bartending: Memoirs of an Apple Genius</em></a><em></em>. The short book is just under 50-pages and details the customers and problems Hackett saw while working as a Genius.</p>

	Marketplace's China correspondent Rob Schmitz is known as the man who <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/03/16/whoopsie-daisey-npr-this-american-life-episode-on-foxconns-ipa/">uncovered the falsehoods about Foxconn factory conditions</a> being told by Mike Daisey in his play, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/02/06/mike-daiseys-the-agony-and-the-ecstasy-of-steve-jobs-is-funny/"><em>The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs</em></a>. As a follow-up to the report, Schmitz got an inside look at a Foxconn factory in Shenzhen.

	AT&amp;T began <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/atandt-to-begin-unlocking-off-contract-iphones-april-8/">unlocking iPhones this weekend</a>. The unlocking process is being described as easy but long, according to <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/12/04/09/att.iphone.unlocking.detailed/">a report on Electronista</a> and <a href="http://forums.imore.com/iphone-3gs-forum/232885-t-unlock.html">forum posts at iMore</a>.</p>
<p>
	Customers only need to provide their phone's IMEI to AT&amp;T <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2012/04/no-human-interaction-required-att-iphone-unlock-can-be-done-via-itunes.ars">online</a> or in a store, and then they wait for Apple to unlock the phone. This wait period may be as short as a few minutes or as long as four to six days. Most customers are being told to expect to wait up to 72 hours for the unlock to go through Apple's system. </p>
<p>
	Keep in mind that only iPhones that are out of contract are eligible for an unlock; alternatively, the customer can pay out the contract kill fee and then request the unlock. Phones that are still covered by a two-year AT&amp;T agreement are not eligible.</p>

<p>
	In two years, the iPad has become a household name. Now it may be turning into a generic term for all tablet products, says <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/07/brand-name-generic-apple-ipad-tablet_n_1409695.html?ref=ap">a report by the AP's Mae Anderson</a>.</p>
<p>
	The "genericization" of brand names happens over and over again, but it only affects a small fraction of all brands (estimated at less than 5% in the US). Band-Aid, Thermos, Kleenex, Yo-Yo and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin#Trademark">aspirin</a> all started out as brand names that have (to a greater or lesser degree) become generic terms for the products they identify. For most consumers, "iPad" describes all tablets the same way "Xerox" refers to any photocopier or "Googling" covers off on all Internet search.</p>
<p>
	Some argue that being thought of as a generic product will weaken a brand, and in fact brands like Kleenex and Xerox spend a lot of money and effort fighting against the genericization of their trademarks. But copyright law professor Jessica Litman of the University of Michigan points out that Apple is "able to skate pretty close to the generics line while making it very clear the name is a trademark of the Apple version of this general category."</p>
<p>
	<a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/189381378708750337">Nilay Patel</a> of The Verge <a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/189380031649284096">disagrees vehemently</a>, saying on Twitter that Apple's defense of the iPad brand is far too strong to allow for any trademark dilution that would lead to generic status. He says that the AP's story "badly distorts" trademark law.</p>
<p>
	Edging a bit towards generic status could work in Apple's favor as competition between the iPad and Android tablets like the Kindle Fire heat up. Potential customers looking for a tablet will head to the store and may ask for an iPad (even if they mean "tablet" in the general sense). Instead of being shown several different tablets, the customer will be taken directly to the iPads and likely will walk away with the Apple device.</p>

	A <a href="http://www.stenvall-skoeld.com/1579/china-iphone-ipad-analysis">report from Chinese strategic advisory firm Stenvall Skoeld</a> suggests that Apple has a 10 percent penetration rate in China with the highest levels of ownership found in urban centers like Beijing, Guandong and Shanghai. The lowest percentage of ownership was found in Tibet which had a 0.1 percent penetration rate.</p>
<p>
	The report also claims that, at the end of 2011, China was home to 21 million iPhones and iPad. The actual number may be higher as China Mobile, which does not carry the iPhone, says it has 15 million iPhone users on its network.</p>

	National Geographic is known for its stunning photography and outstanding videos. Now you can get a portion of both each day with the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/national-geographic-today/id512719216">National Geographic Today App</a>. Released last week, the iPad app includes news, videos, quizzes, articles, and jaw-dropping photography.</p>
<p>
	The National Geographic Today app serves up a fresh dose of material each day and lets you browse through seven days of back content. Like the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/national-geographic-society/id315268468">other National Geographic apps</a>, the format and content of the Today app looks fantastic on the first iPad and the iPad 2. Unfortunately, it does not take advantage of the retina display of the new iPad but, hopefully, this is just a temporary situation and a retina update will be available soon.</p>
<p>
	You can download <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/national-geographic-today/id512719216">National Geographic Today</a> from the iOS App Store for free.</p>

	<em>Dear Aunt TUAW,</em></p>
<p>
	I just received this text from AT&amp;T:<br />
	<br />
	"Network changes may soon impact your 2G phone service. Exchange 2G phone @ AT&amp;T store w/free 3G AT&amp;T U2800A phone by 5/15 &amp; avoid service impact."<br />
	<br />
	I wonder what this means? On the one hand, it's an excuse to get a new iPhone; on the other, I really wanted to hit the 5 year mark using this phone. :(<br />
	<br />
	It has served me well, even after an unpleasant fall into a toilet.<br />
	<br />
	Anyhow, I'm sure I'm not the only one still using the original phone.</p>
<p>
	Is AT&amp;T making my original iPhone unusable? :(</p>
<p>
	<em>Your loving niece,</em></p>
<p>
	<em>Lisa</em></p>

<p>
	AT&amp;T <a href="http://www.khsltv.com/mostpopular/story/AT-T-To-Shut-Down-2G-Making-Upgrades-To-3G/8ljeHBRQ9UiARm4y5grB6A.cspx">announced this policy</a> about a year ago. If you want to keep using an iPhone, you can pick up a free 3GS from them in exchange for agreeing to a 2-year contract.</p>
<p>
	Otherwise, you might consider buying one used from eBay. It will let you continue service sans contract, but be aware. Once you start using 3G service instead of EDGE, your monthly unlimited data will rise from $20 to $30 a month.</p>
<p>
	You can, of course, accept their offer for the free U2800A phone -- but why give up your Apple iOS lifestyle?</p>
<p>
	Hugs,</p>
<p>
	Auntie T.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/09/dear-aunt-tuaw-is-atandt-killing-my-iphone/">Dear Aunt TUAW: Is AT&amp;T killing my iPhone?</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Mon, 09 Apr 2012 08:00:00 EST.

<p>
	Given the requirements of a Java installation to enable the trojan's exploit, it looks like a nontrivial number of infections have <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/04/05/flashback">hit experienced Mac users</a>.

</p>
<p>
	Remember that missing iPhone 4S that was <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/09/26/san-fran-pd-looking-for-security-footage-at-lost-iphone-bar/">allegedly lost at the Cava 22 lounge</a> and tracked to a residence in San Francisco? The home was possibly searched illegally by Apple security and the home's owner, Sergio Calderon, <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-57340540-261/apple-searched-his-home-for-errant-iphone-now-he-plans-to-sue/">threatened to sue</a>. It appears the whole debacle may have been settled out of court, says <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/blog/looks-apple-paid-victim-ham-handed-iphone-search">a report in Network World</a>.</p>
<p>
	Information about the case hasn't surface in months which prompted Network World to follow up with Calderon's lawyer David Monroe. Monroe refused to comment on any question, which led Network World to speculate that Apple settled the case. Apple may have paid a settlement and required a nondisclosure agreement that prevented Calderon or Monroe from talking further about those events.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/08/settlement-may-have-been-reached-in-missing-iphone-4s-case/">Settlement may have been reached in missing iPhone 4S case</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Sun, 08 Apr 2012 09:30:00 EST.

<p>
	In early March, TUAW's intrepid <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/03/01/withings-baby-monitor-works-with-iphone-isnt-cheap/">Dave Caolo reported on the U.S. release</a> of the <a href="http://www.withings.com/en/babymonitor">Withings Smart Baby Monitor</a>, a US$299 device that works with your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to let you keep an eye on your baby, aging parents or grandparents, or even your pets. As you'll see later in this review, it does more than your average cheap Wi-Fi baby monitor, even providing a level of two-way interaction.</p>
<h3>
	Design</h3>
<p>
	I am a huge fan of Withings products, all of which are incredibly well-designed and very functional. I've used a <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/09/15/road-tested-the-withings-scale-an-apple-accessory-you-can-stan/">Withings Wi-Fi Body Scale</a> for almost two years and keep my health in check with their <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/06/20/withings-blood-pressure-monitor-an-ios-friendly-way-to-track-yo/">iOS-connected blood pressure monitor</a>, and both devices work flawlessly month after month. As I'd expect, the Smart Baby Monitor is another Withings product that balances great design and functionality with easy integration to your favorite iOS device.</p>
<p>
	The monitor is a small 3.6" x 3.6" x 2.5" (92mm x 92 mm x 63 mm), .65 lb. (293 gms) white box that flips open like a jewel box to reveal the camera and many controls. It's actually quite attractive, looking more like something that Jony Ive would design for Apple than your run-of-the-mill webcam. The monitor has a 3 megapixel HD camera at 2048 x 1536 pixels -- that's identical to the resolution of the new iPad.</p>
<p>
	The Smart Baby Monitor also has a large speaker through which your voice or lullabies can be transmitted to baby, a multicolor nightlight, audio sensors, humidity and temperature sensors, and tactile command buttons. There's also a support stand for attaching the monitor to a crib, although it can be set on almost any flat surface and has a surprisingly wide-angle lens.</p>

<p>
	For nighttime use, the monitor has infrared LEDs that "light up" the area up to about 15 feet (5 meters) away. Those LEDs automatically power up or down based on the amount of ambient light in the room. There's even a carry bag included if you wish to take the Smart Baby Monitor with you on a trip.</p>
<p>
	To connect to the Internet, you'll need to have either a Wi-Fi network (up to 802.11n) or Ethernet connection. The monitor also requires a nearby power plug, although it can run off of an internal Lithium-ion battery for use when you're not near a plug. A handy red LED flashes near the power socket on the monitor to tell you when you need to recharge the battery.</p>
<h3>
	Setup and Functionality</h3>
<p>
	As with the other Withings products I've used, the Smart Baby Monitor is a piece of cake to get set up and running. Once the device is plugged in and powered up, you make a Bluetooth connection to the monitor through the iOS settings app on your favorite device. As soon as a connection is established (no pairing code required), you're asked if you wish to install an app from the app store -- that's the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/withings-withbaby/id467594466?mt=8">WithBaby app</a> (free). With three taps and your iTunes password, the app is installed, and you can launch it.</p>
<p>
	You're asked if you wish to accept push notifications. With this capability, you can receive alerts from the monitor on sound, movement, temperature or humidity. You'll need to set up a free account, which requires only an email address and a password. You can have up to three different accounts connect to the monitor simultaneously. One nice feature is that by default, the iOS app is set up to monitor sound even when the WithBaby app isn't running.</p>
<p>
	There's a place to set up a baby profile. When I added one, there was a Next button at the bottom of the profile page that didn't seem to work -- I had to kill the app, then start it up again and go through the process a second time in order to get it to finish. Once that was complete, I had access to a high-resolution image of the room the camera was pointed to. Double-tapping or reverse-pinching the screen allowed me to zoom in on details. In bright lighting conditions, the image is in color; when the infrared illumination is turned on the image is grayscale.</p>
<p>
	Unlike many web cameras with the ability to be used in dark conditions, the bright-light abilities of the Smart Baby Monitor are incredibly good. I was even able to point the camera out into the bright Colorado sunshine and get a shot out the window.</p>
<p>
	With a tap on the screen, you get access to some simple controls that provide a way to look at sound and motion in the room over the past fifteen minutes, speak to your baby, turn the nightlight off or on, play lullabies, or take a screenshot. The nightlight can also be set to a number of different colors and intensities through the app. There are four built-in lullabies -- it does not appear that there's a way to add your own from iTunes.</p>
<p>
	Since the video is transferred through Withings' server to securely travel to your iOS device, there's a bit of a lag in both the video and audio. However, that lag was only about a second or two at worst, which is much better than the ten-second lag I've seen with some other monitors.</p>
<p>
	One thing that I wish Withings and other companies would do is market these as "home monitors" rather than baby monitors. For people with elderly relatives, this product would be a great way to keep an eye (and ear) on them and even talk to them on a regular basis, and I can see where this would be an amazing product for watching what the dog or cat is doing while you're away from home. You could even yell at your pet if she's clawing at the couch.</p>
<h3>
	Conclusion</h3>
<p>
	Withings makes great products, although the $300 price tag on the monitor is a bit steep -- you might want to ask someone to give you one of these for a baby shower gift. The video is some of the best I've seen from a baby monitor, and the feature set is unparalleled. I can definitely recommend the Smart Baby Monitor to any new or prospective parents as a top-notch product that will keep them happy through baby's first years and beyond.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/07/keep-an-eye-on-those-you-love-with-the-withings-smart-baby-monit/">Keep an eye on those you love with the Withings Smart Baby Monitor</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Sat, 07 Apr 2012 16:00:00 EST.

We put the question to you and let you have your go at it. Today's topic is smartphones. When it comes to display size, is bigger really better?</p>
<p>
	Recently, a number of manufacturers have produced touch-based smart phones <a href="http://www.thetechblock.com/articles/2012/samsungs-super-sized-galaxy-note-changed-my-life/">roughly the size of baby dolphins</a>. At 5.3" the Galaxy note makes the iPhone look like a <a href="http://snltranscripts.jt.org/88/88ghansfranz.phtml">wee little girly man</a> in comparison.</p>
<p>
	Is the iPhone a sad shrunken remnant of outdated smartphones? Or are the new jumbo-sized units on the market our new pumped-up smartphone overlords? Sure, size matters -- but in which direction?</p>
<p>
	You tell us. Place your vote in this poll and then join in the comments with all your analysis.</p>

	Another oldie but goodie is <a href="http://www.ipodnn.com/articles/12/04/06/will.sport.new.graphics.custom.controls/">getting the iOS treatment</a>, and if you loved the original Max Payne you'll be buying this one. I've never found the controls on these games where I want, but word is the Payne update will offer some customization for touchscreens. Look for more of that here, with HD graphics and the requisite Social Club connectivity and that good old bullet time action.</p>

<p>
	There are some Mac users who just keep piles of bare hard disk and solid state disk drives around. By bare drives, I mean that they're not in any sort of external drive enclosure. This can be handy, since bare drives are inexpensive -- you don't need to pay for the enclosure or power supply. <a href="http://www.wiebetech.com/products/UltraDock_v5.php">WiebeTech's UltraDock v5</a> (US$249.00) is the latest in a series of docks that provide a way for you to easily use those bare drives with your Mac. As you'll see later on in this review, this device is primarily aimed at IT professionals.</p>
<p>
	The UltraDock v5 improves upon its predecessor, the UltraDock v4, by adding an upgraded chip set and faster connections. WiebeTech says that the UltraDock v5 was clocked at a throughput of 211.9 MB/second when used with an eSATA SSD. This small (4.3" x 2.95" x 0.87" -- 110mm x 75mm x 22mm) blue box now comes equipped with two FireWire 800 ports, a USB 3.0 port, and an eSATA port in addition to a single FireWire 400 port. That's just on the host side. The drive side has a SATA drive port, a power out port, and an IDE/PATA drive port. You can also buy WiebeTech's Combo Adapters to connect to a variety of other oddball drives, like 1.8" drives or PCCard drives.</p>
<p>
	To give the UltraDock v5 a try, I gathered up a few drives that had been collecting dust around my house. There was an old LaCie 160 GB hard drive that I kept around, even though the power supply had failed years ago. Hmmm ... I wonder what's on that drive? I plugged in the rugged (and pretty darned large) power brick and ran the power cable to the UltraDock, then pulled out the necessary cables from the box. For this old 3.5" drive, I used the IDE cable (about 4" long) to connect the UltraDock. The drive also needed power, so I used the included standard 4-wire power connector.</p>

<p>
	Powered up, the UltraDock's two-line LCD displayed "View Drive Info." Using the four-way pad on the front of the UltraDock, I was able to pull up a ton of data about the drive -- the disk temperature, capacity in MB, manufacturer, model number, serial number, firmware revision, starts/stops, power cycles, and more. That information can be critical for IT types who might be wondering if they can reuse an "old" drive or not.</p>
<p>
	Other top level commands from the two-line display include viewing info about the dock itself, HPA/DCO auto and create HPA/DCO. Those last two settings are for Host Protected Area and Device Configuration Overlay, both methods of creating hidden areas not normally visible to an operating system.</p>
<p>
	After exhausting those commands, I decided to connect the UltraDock and iMac through USB just to see if I could mount it and view the data on the drive. The drive mounted quickly, and I was able to find that I had last used the drive back in 2007 to back up a client's computer. That information was deleted and I now have a nice naked 160 GB drive to play with at some point.</p>
<p>
	The next drive I tested was a 2.5" laptop drive. Fortunately, the proper cable was included with the UltraDock to connect to both drive power and the dock's SATA port. Once again, I used the USB cable to connect the bare drive to the iMac, and I was able to see that I had 160 GB of capacity on this drive, and had erased it at some point.</p>
<p>
	Who's the target market for the UltraDock? I'd think that IT repair departments would love to have something like this on hand to connect a hodgepodge of old bare drives to a Mac or PC for troubleshooting or to remove data contained on them. At $249, it's a bit more expensive than most Mac owners will want to spend unless they have a real need to work with a variety of drives. I personally use a $29.95 <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/NewerTech/U3NVSPATA/">Universal Drive Adapter</a> from Newer Technology to connect most oddball drives to my Mac -- it only has a USB connection, but can connect to most 2.5", 3.5", and 5.25" hard drives.</p>
<p>
	Likewise, Newer Technology's <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/NewerTech/Voyager/Hard_Drive_Dock">Voyager</a> dock ($79.99) is a great way to swap out bare drives. I know a number of podcasters who use bare drives and the Voyager to archive old episodes of their shows.</p>
<p>
	The UltraDock v5 definitely takes bare drive docks to a higher level than either of the Newer Tech solutions and fits a niche market that definitely needs a dock with the ability to connect to almost any drive ever made. If you also need to install HPAs or DCOs, there's no other product I know of that will do this. Finally, the UltraDock v5 can be used with WiebeTech's Encryptor to encrypt or decrypt bare hard drives with 256-bit AES encryption; perfect for government IT shops that may need to install encrypted images.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/wiebetech-ultradock-v5-a-marriage-of-macs-and-bare-drives/">WiebeTech UltraDock v5: A marriage of Macs and bare drives</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 06 Apr 2012 18:00:00 EST.

	Whether you are taking a trip to your local museum or a trip around the world, there will be moments that you'll want to remember. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trip-pages/id508474864?mt=8a">Trip Pages</a> from <a href="http://studeo4ios.com/">Studeo410</a> lets you capture that moment with a picture, a note and relevant location information.</p>
<p>
	The first thing I noticed about Trip Pages is its pleasing, yet technical looking interface. The app launches with a screen that shows a compass with your heading, GPS co-ordinates, speed and weather. It even displays your elevation based on your GPS location.</p>
<p>
	At the bottom of the screen, there's buttons to display your location on a map, take a picture, and view your library of saved locations, which the app calls "pages." Each page stores your GPS co-ordinates, along with a picture and a note that describes the event you want to save. It also records the date and time.</p>
<p>
	You can organize your pages into folders and upload them to Dropbox for long-term storage or share them with friends and family via email, Twitter or Facebook. You can also view the saved locations on a map and see how it compares to your current location.</p>
<p>
	Trip Pages is a wonderful app for travelers, wanderers and anyone else who wants to mark and remember their location. I don't travel much, but I plan to use Trip Pages to help mark trees and landmarks in our woods where I setup my trail cams. I should be able to retrieve the stored camera locations and find them pretty quickly. I also see myself using it when I encounter a new trailhead, fishing pond or local pizza joint that I want to remember.</p>
<p>
	<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trip-pages/id508474864?mt=8a">Trip Pages</a> is available for $1.99 from the iOS App Store. The compass part of the app works with iOS devices that have an magnetometer which includes the iPhone 3GS/4/4S. The compass will not work with the iPod Touch, the original iPhone and the iPhone 3G. Also, some of the features like weather require an active Internet connection.</p>

	AT&amp;T confirmed today that it will unlock customers' post-contract iPhones starting Sunday, April 8. AT&amp;T <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/06/atandt-to-begin-unlocking-iphone-sunday-april-8/">told Engadget</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>
		Beginning Sunday, April 8, we will offer qualifying customers the ability to unlock their AT&amp;T iPhones. The only requirements are that a customer's account must be in good standing, their device cannot be associated with a current and active term commitment on an AT&amp;T customer account, and they need to have fulfilled their contract term, upgraded under one of our upgrade policies or paid an early termination fee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
	This is good news for customers who travel abroad. When they reach their destination, customers will be able to purchase a less-expensive SIM from a local carrier, instead of subscribing to an AT&amp;T international plan.</p>
<p>
	We've asked AT&amp;T to clarify if this will be only for the iPhone 4S, or other models as well, but at this time haven't received a reply.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/atandt-to-begin-unlocking-off-contract-iphones-april-8/">AT&amp;T to begin unlocking off-contract iPhones April 8</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 06 Apr 2012 16:30:00 EST.

<p>
	There's no shortage of photo editing apps for iOS, and I am constantly amazed at the quality and the creativity of the offerings. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/process/id435587440?mt=8">Process</a> (US $2.99 universal app) has some unique features that can breathe some new life into your photos. The app features non-destructive editing, so you can apply multiple filters with one layer for each effect. It feels a bit like using Adobe Photoshop on my desktop Mac, but Process is much simpler to use. Photos are saved in full resolution, unlike the somewhat disappointing <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/02/27/adobe-photoshop-touch-for-ipad-2/">Adobe Photoshop Touch</a> app for iOS. You can save your effects to use again, or share with others. If you use the app on both an iPhone and an iPad you can transfer the effects between devices via the cloud. The app supports the new Retina Display on the latest iPad.</p>
<p>
	Process is a pleasure to use. The app has many presets and they are quite good. At first glance, they are not as varied or extreme as some of the other filter apps out there, but frankly, that is what I like about them. There's nothing over the top, and your pictures stay naturalistic, which is my processing style. You can certainly push the effects quite a bit, but they never look like a bad LSD trip.</p>
<p>
	The app doesn't have some of the more popular effects, like tilt-shift, but again, that's not what this app is about. You can add layer after layer of effects, remove any of them to see how your processing is going, and try different combinations, all without destroying the original image. Help is built-in and is comprehensive.</p>
<p>
	If you want to do more dramatic filtering and processing, I still like <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2011/12/09/daily-ipad-app-snapseed/">Snapseed</a> from NIK software, but I think Process is very well thought out, extremely flexible, and can improve your images without turning them into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol">Andy Warhol</a> type art. <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iphoto/id497786065?mt=8">iPhoto</a> is also an excellent choice for photo editing, but it has a <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/on-mystery-meat-gestures-and-iphotos-learning-curve/">higher learning curve</a>.</p>

<p>
	I am <em>not</em> an artist. I love art, but don't have the necessary skills (except for those I've picked up on my own) to really do anything that I'd want other people to see. When some of the early iPad drawing/painting apps started coming out, I eagerly bought them to try, but found that my lack of talent was just transferred to a new medium. A new iPad app, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/paper-by-fiftythree/id506003812?mt=8">Paper</a> by FiftyThree (Free, in-app tool purchases available) may actually help me to become a half-decent artist.</p>
<p>
	After you've downloaded Paper, you have a one tool available - Draw. Draw is an expressive ink pen that responds much like the steel-nibbed pens we used in art class in 7th grade, except there's no way to drip ink on yourself or the page. All of the other art tools -- Color, Sketch, Write, and Outline -- are available through in-app purchase for US$1.99 each or as a combined "Essentials" purchase for $7.99.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
	<img alt="Image" height="342" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2012/04/img0855.jpg" style="margin:4px" width="456" /></p>
<p>
	Launching Paper, you see three <a href="http://moleskine.com/">Moleskine</a>-like notebooks on the screen. To open one for viewing, you tap on it, and you're immediately rewarded with a two-page view of the notebook. To zoom in on a set of pages, make another tap; to get back to the notebook view, you pinch two fingers together. New notebooks can be added from the main screen of the app by tapping a "+" button, or erased with the tap of a trash can button. You can name each notebook, and give it a cover photo or texture.</p>
<p>
	Once you're in a page view in a notebook, you can begin to draw or paint. I immediately purchased the Color (water painting) and Sketch (pencil drawing) tools; I frankly wish I had just spent the full $7.99 and bought the Essentials. When drawing or painting, you can either use the eraser tool or a "rewind" function to get rid of mistakes. Rewind uses an swipe and rotate gesture to "turn back the clock" on your misdeeds.</p>
<p>
	The tools are all available from a tool tray that slides up with a swipe and can be put away with another swipe. I found myself grabbing a tool and color, then dropping the tray out of sight so I could concentrate on my work.</p>
<p>
	For each tool, you have a limited palette of nine colors. Unfortunately, you can't change that palette. The Fifty-Three team says that they want people to concentrate on creating, not getting picky about colors. While this works well with some tools, like Color, which let you blend transparent colors, it's kind of annoying with the pen and pencil tools. You can layer different colors, of course, so I'm not sure that alternative palettes are a definite need -- instead, Paper users just need to understand how to layer colors properly. A quick look at the comments on the FiftyThree support forums shows that many people are asking for alternative palettes.</p>
<p>
	I've dabbled in watercolors in the past, and I found the Color tool to be the closest thing yet to a watercolor set for the iPad. The tool works just like a watercolor brush, letting you build up color by laying on more "paint," blend colors, even use the white paint like a gouache. I didn't try the Write and Outline tools, but they are essentially fine and broad point markers for marking up your paper.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; ">
	<img alt="Image" height="342" src="http://www.blogcdn.com/www.tuaw.com/media/2012/04/img0856.jpg" style="margin:4px" width="456" /></p>
<p>
	The Sketch tool is also the best pencil-drawing tool I've found for the iPad. Using my <a href="http://adonit.net/news/adonit-jot-jot-pro-aluminum-stylus-review-gadgetmac-com/">Adonit Writer Pro stylus</a> with Paper, I felt like I was really drawing on a piece of paper. Speaking of the paper, your "canvas" is 2048 x 1536 pixels, so it takes advantage of the Retina display.</p>
<p>
	Images that you create can be shared through Tumblr, Facebook, Twitter or by sending an email. When you share an image, it's exported as a JPEG at 1024 x 768 pixels. I found a good way to get full-resolution images -- I just do an iPad screenshot, and then the image shows up in my Photo Stream in full resolution.</p>
<p>
	How good is Paper? Let's just say that every other "art app" that I purchased in the past has been taken off of my iPad. I love the concept and execution of this app, and it's going to be my sketch and watercolor pad from now on. Paper makes me wish that I hadn't spent a lot of money a few years ago putting together a portable watercolor kit...</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/daily-ipad-app-paper-by-fiftythree-may-make-you-an-artist/">Daily iPad App: Paper by FiftyThree may make you an artist</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 06 Apr 2012 14:00:00 EST.

<p>
	Apple has some unusual bedfellows, Intel and Qualcomm, in a patent infringement case that it's fighting with Samsung in Australia. According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-04-04/qualcomm-intel-provide-source-code-in-patent-fight-apple-says.html">a Bloomberg report</a>, Intel and Qualcomm agreed to provide the Australian court with source code that'll prove Apple isn't infringing on patents held by Samsung.</p>
<p>
	The trial is slated to begin July 9 and will run through October 12. The Sydney Federal Court is expecting the trial to be a blockbuster affair and may assign a second judge and a court-appointed expert to serve at the trial.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/qualcomm-intel-provide-source-code-in-patent-battle/">Qualcomm, Intel provide source code in patent battle</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 06 Apr 2012 13:00:00 EST.

	Apple may be opening a second Apple Store in Rome and will be celebrating the grand opening on Rome's birthday, says <a href="http://www.ispazio.net/319306/il-nuovo-apple-store-di-porta-di-roma-aprira-il-21-aprile-ecco-alcune-spy-photos-ispazio">a report in iSpazio</a>. The new store will be located in the Porta di Roma shopping mall and will open on April 21, 2012, the date when Italy will commemorate the city's founding in 753 BC. iSpazio supposedly has photos of the store under construction which you can check out on <a href="http://www.ispazio.net/319306/il-nuovo-apple-store-di-porta-di-roma-aprira-il-21-aprile-ecco-alcune-spy-photos-ispazio">their website</a>.</p>

<p>
	Just shy of a month after its release, <a href="http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2012/03/14/mystery_meat_iphoto/">Lukas Mathis provides well-reasoned criticism</a> regarding the learning curve for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/iphoto/id497786065?mt=8">iPhoto for iOS</a>. It's new territory for Apple, as he points out, but it might be pushing the boundaries a little too hard.</p>
<p>
	As much as <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/03/07/hands-on-with-iphoto-for-ios/">I like the new iPhoto myself</a>, Mathis brings up some good points regarding some of the gestures. I disagree with him on the help provided in the app. I think this is probably Apple's best help menu, especially on an iOS app. It's dynamic and changes with the tool you're using and helps you to utilize iPhoto better.</p>
<p>
	Even though the tools change, I can undo anything I've done by clicking on the bottom right spoke button. What Apple does, I notice, is that it helps you along the way and then makes you take a leap of logic regarding the next step. The example that Mathis provides is the magnifying loupe. Holding down two fingers gets you the loupe, as the help menu suggests. But it doesn't tell you to twist on the black rim to increase the magnification. Does Apple need to tell you that? Probably. Or maybe the developers were guessing that you're most likely going to twist your fingers on your own and figure it out anyhow.</p>
<p>
	And Mathis is correct in that the buttons in iPhoto on the iPhone are just way too small. I found that on the iPhone, I've gone back to my tried-and-true <a href="http://campl.us/">Camera+</a> for photo editing there.</p>
<p>
	What do you think? With iPhoto for iOS having been out for a few weeks, what are your thoughts now? Let us know in the comments.</p>

	Advertising is poised to take a bigger role in mobile gaming now that Electronic Arts has signed a multimillion dollar, year-long advertising campaign with Unilever, says <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120404/theres-four-types-of-advertising-emerging-in-social-games-ea-says/">a report in AllThingsD</a>. Unilever is a <a href="http://www.unilever.com/">multinational consumer goods company</a> that owns such brands as Dove, Ben &amp; Jerry's, Lipton and more.</p>
<p>
	EA is using its popular Facebook game, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TheSimsSocial">The Sims Social</a>, as a vector to introduce advertising for Unilever products like Dove. When players enter the bathroom, they will be able to shower with Dove shampoo. During the summer, their refrigerators can be stocked with Magnum Mini ice cream bars. These branded virtual goods are enticing to players because they are often offered for free.</p>
<p>
	This advertising deal isn't limited to Facebook. It's a cross-platform agreement that could push branded virtual goods into The Sims line of games on iOS devices and consoles like the Xbox 360.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/ea-emerging-ad-trends-in-social-games/">EA: emerging ad trends in social games</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 06 Apr 2012 11:30:00 EST.

<p>
	<em><strong>Updated</strong> with comment from Dropbox, note regarding LinkedIn and clarifications throughout.</em></p>
<p>
	Let's clear this up quickly: Yes, there's a <a href="http://garethwright.com/blog/facebook-mobile-security-hole-allows-identity-theft">security hole in the Facebook app</a>. The Next Web also <a href="http://thenextweb.com/mobile/2012/04/06/security-hole-in-facebook-ios-app-doesnt-require-jailbreak-or-theft-and-dropbox-has-it-too/">confirmed the same issue in the Dropbox app</a>, and a commenter below suggests that Vimeo and Tumblr official apps have the same core vulnerability. <a href="http://blog.scoopz.com/2012/04/07/linkedin-ios-app-also-vulnerable-to-plist-identity-theft/">LinkedIn's app</a> also apparently works the same way.</p>
<p>
	The good news is this: It's very unlikely anyone would get access to your Facebook account this way. To do so, the hypothetical hacker would have to have physical access to your iPhone, and once someone has physical control of your device you've got plenty of bigger problems.</p>
<p>
	Even if someone tried to trick you into falling for this exploit <em>without</em> stealing your phone, you'd have to allow them to plug your device into their computer or a rigged dock/charging station, then allow them to <strike>do a bunch of business on your phone to</strike> grab a plain text file stored by these, then they'd have to take that file to a different iOS device in order to go and do something malicious on your Facebook or Dropbox accounts.</p>
<p>
	[In theory, if you plugged your non-passcode-locked phone into an untrusted computer or peripheral to charge it, a piece of software on that computer could surreptitiously grab the key files without your knowledge. No such malicious app is currently known to exist in the wild, but <strike>it's not outside the realm of possibility</strike> researcher <a href="http://garethwright.com/blog/facebook-mobile-security-hole-allows-identity-theft">Gareth Wright was able to "knock together" several proofs of concept</a>, including a modified speaker dock and a credit-card sized hardware capture tool. -Ed.]</p>
<p>
	Although other sites have reported that a jailbroken device is required to access this exploit, that is simply not true. A desktop app like <a href="http://www.macroplant.com/iexplorer/">iExplorer</a> or <a href="http://ecamm.com/mac/phoneview/">PhoneView</a>, which allow you to access application-stored files on an iOS device, will allow you to exploit the security hole.</p>
<p>
	It works like this: some iOS apps use little text files (.plist aka property list files) to store all sorts of little things about an app. In this case, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Facebook and others are using an unencrypted property list to apparently store both the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth key</a> and its secret counterpart.</p>
<p>
	That's...astonishingly naive. (I wonder how many other apps don't do the same thing.) Apple provides a secure mechanism (the <a href="http://iphonedevelopertips.com/core-services/using-keychain-to-store-username-and-password.html">system keychain</a>) which is meant for exactly this purpose: providing a non-visible storage system for sensitive data.</p>
<p>
	Once a malicious person has used iExplorer to find the right plist, that file can be copied and dropped onto another device. That second device would then be able to access your account as though you had already logged in. Using a property list in this way leaves us scratching our heads.</p>
<p>
	Facebook has issued a comment saying it will patch this soon. I haven't seen any statement from Dropbox yet. That being said, this was a dumb mistake on Facebook's and Dropbox's parts -- they should have known better.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Update</strong>: Dropbox issued a statement as well, noting the Android version doesn't suffer from this vulnerability. Also, the company is working on a fix now. The statement is pasted below.</p>
<p>
	The Next Web did a little more testing and points out that the exploit can't be leveraged if you have set a passcode on your device -- an unfamiliar computer can't pull files from your phone if it's passcode-locked.</p>
<p>
	From Dropbox:</p>
<p>
	<em>We are currently updating our iOS app to do the same. We note that the attack in question requires a malicious actor to have physical access to a user's device. In a situation like that, a user is susceptible to all sorts of threats, so we strongly advise safeguarding devices.</em></p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/facebook-dropbox-ios-apps-contain-security-hole-that-could-allo/">Facebook, Dropbox iOS apps contain security hole that could allow identity theft (Updated)</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 06 Apr 2012 10:45:00 EST.

<p>
	A team of German researchers is working on technology that could let you ski all day without worrying about your smartphone battery, says a report in <a href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/germany/120405/solar-powered-helmet-charge-iphone-theres-a-hat-for-that">GlobalPost</a>. Scientists from the Fraunhofer Institute in Berlin, TEXSYS and the Technical University in Berlin have created a solar helmet that charges your mobile device while you ski. The helmet has a curved solar panel skin, integrated headphones and a microphone so you can use your phone or mp3 player on the slopes.</p>
<p>
	They've also designed a special set of gloves that can control your mobile device. Though it might not appeal to your casual, recreational skier, this solar system could be useful for adventurers who need extra juice for a long day mountaineering as well as mountain rescue teams who would appreciate the always-on communication.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/ski-helmet-charges-ipods-iphone-and-other-mobile-devices/">Ski helmet charges iPods, iPhone and other mobile devices</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 06 Apr 2012 10:30:00 EST.

	Computer historian David Greelish <a href="http://classiccomputing.com/CC/Blog/Entries/2012/3/31_Apple_should_have_a_corporate_museum_and_public_space_at_their_new_campus..html">argues in a blog post</a> that Apple should build a museum on the grounds of its new Cupertino campus. He points out that the flying ring-shaped office will attract everyone from architects to Apple fans who want to check out the unique building.</p>
<p>
	Apple, Greelish says, should embrace these tourists and build a museum that'll showcase Apple's achievements. Greelish offers his ideas on how the museum should be built and even provides a few sample designs.</p>
<p>
	Greelish isn't the first one to propose an Apple museum. Apple toyed with the idea of a corporate museum in the past, but Steve Jobs rejected the idea and gave <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/12/29/apple-stanford-archive/">a collection of Apple memorabilia</a> to Stanford University instead.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/should-apple-build-a-museum-on-the-new-campus/">Should Apple build a museum on the new campus?</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 06 Apr 2012 10:15:00 EST.

<p>
	Apple and other handset manufacturers are involved in so many lawsuits that it's difficult to keep up. Earlier this week, another infringement lawsuit in Chicago that's been around for a while resurfaced because Apple dropped a patent from the lawsuit. Apple was complying with a request from Judge Richard Posner who told the two parties involved in the case to winnow their claims, says <a href="http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/04/apple-drops-patent-on-centralized-event.html">a report in FOSS Patents</a>.</p>
<p>
	Both Apple and Motorola are involved in this Chicago case, which started off with claims involving fifteen Apple and six Motorola patents. That number, says FOSS Patents, has been whittled down by one-third. The latest patent to hit the chopping block was <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5,566,337.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5,566,337&amp;RS=PN/5,566,337">U.S. Patent No. 5,566,337</a> which describes a "method and apparatus for distributing events in an operating system." According to Florian Mueller of FOSS Patents, this patent was a good choice to remove because it was a longshot that a judge would rule in Apple's favor on that infringement claim.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/apple-drops-alert-patent-in-chicago-litigation-against-motorola/">Apple drops alert patent in Chicago litigation against Motorola</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Fri, 06 Apr 2012 10:00:00 EST.

<p>
	The iPad's journey to becoming more of a content-producing and creative tool took another step forward recently with the release of a new app called <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pholium/id479334940?mt=8">Pholium</a> (US$9.99). The app is centered around the creation, viewing, and sharing of iPad photo ebooks.</p>
<p>
	All of the creation of the photo ebooks is done on the iPad. Whether you're taking images from a camera through the Apple Camera Connection Kit or using photos you took with the iPad's camera, all of your camera roll images are available in the Pholium Gallery. The Gallery lets you bring in Photo Stream images as well, and you can store the pictures that you want to use in your ebook.</p>
<p>
	Once you have a collection of photos to place in your ebook, you move to the Studio -- a place in the app where images are placed into the book for viewing, arranged or rotated, and text is added. One issue I had with the app is that text can only be added to certain special pages -- when producing photo books with iPhoto, I like to put some captions on images and occasionally write a paragraph or two describing a place shown in the pictures. At least with the 1.0 version of Pholium, you can't do that.</p>
<p>

<p>
	Pholium optimizes photos to look their best in the books, and you can only had cup to 42 images per book. With a 2-page spread, you're limited to 4 images, or 1 image on a full 2-page spread. Pages can be added or removed easily, so it's easy to make your book a bit larger. I felt that the 42 image limit was quite limiting, and I'm hoping that the next version of the app will increase or eliminate the limit.</p>
<p>
	Once you're done creating a book, you can store it in the Pholium Library, and also share the book through the Pholium website with up to 10 recipients. After the first 10 recipients, you need to purchase a new "Pholda" that provides another 10 readers with the ability to see your ebook. Reading the ebooks is a treat -- the app uses an animation that's familiar to iBook readers to emulate the turning of pages. One gripe I had was that the faux "fold" between the left and right pages was too darkly shadowed and really distracting when looking at images that went across both pages.</p>
<p>
	If your recipients don't have Pholium -- which is likely to be the case -- they're sent a low resolution PDF of the images in the books. I preferred the look of the images in the book, where they could be rotated during my production of the book, then tapped by readers for viewing in a larger, non-rotated image.</p>
<p>
	One cool feature was the ability for readers to tap a single button to see a slideshow of all of the images in the book. However, the timing of the appearance of the images and the transitions between images could not be adjusted.</p>
<p>
	Pholium is a pretty powerful and very useful photo ebook tool, but it could benefit from some additional work. I'd like to see the app get rid of the 42 image limitation, add the ability to send the formatted ebook to a print-on-demand service to create a "real" book (like those created with iPhoto), and the ability to add captions and text boxes to every page in the book. Still, if you want to create and share your own picture ebooks with friends or relatives, Pholium is a really easy way to publish without a lot of hassle.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/05/daily-ipad-app-pholium/">Daily iPad App: Pholium</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 05 Apr 2012 21:45:00 EST.

To get you prepared for some spring Mac cleaning over the weekend, <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/06/spring-clean-your-mac-with-erica-and-steve-a-tuaw-live-chat/">Erica Sadun and I will be hosting a live "clinic" tomorrow at 11 AM EDT here on TUAW</a>.</p>
<p>
	We'll start at 11 AM sharp, but you may wish to arrive a few minutes early to log into the CoverItLive system, which is what we'll be using to host the talk. Throughout the chat, we'll be capturing questions and providing answers as best we can, and we always like to hear from our readers about their favorite Mac spring cleaning tips.</p>
<p>
	See you here tomorrow morning bright and early!

		Upgrade Existing Storage with the LaCie eSATA Hub Thunderbolt[TM] Series<br />
		<br />
		Paris, France - Today LaCie announced the availability of the eSATA Hub Thunderbolt[TM] Series, its latest peripheral featuring Thunderbolt technology. This product delivers a solution for connecting eSATA hard drives to Thunderbolt-compatible Mac(R) computers, making them backwards compatible. The eSATA Hub also boosts transfer speeds and allows users to daisy chain with other Thunderbolt peripherals.<br />
		<br />
		Give New Life to eSATA Drives<br />
		Consumers with new Macs who are interested in getting the best possible speeds with their existing multi-interface drives are no longer limited to USB or FireWire connections. In addition, businesses, photographers or other creative professionals who have upgraded their Macs to versions without ExpressCard/34 slots are now able to capitalize on their previous investment in eSATA hard drives.<br />
		<br />
		Daisy Chain Capability<br />
		The eSATA Hub's dual Thunderbolt ports allow users to daisy chain other Thunderbolt peripherals. This means users can connect up to 12 eSATA drives (6 Hubs x 2 eSATA drives per Hub) to a Mac while maintaining full eSATA 3Gb/s speeds. It also helps organize desktops by connecting both a Thunderbolt compatible display and storage device via a single cable (sold separately from www.apple.com) to their Mac.<br />
		<br />
		Availability<br />
		The eSATA Hub Thunderbolt Series is available through the LaCie Online Store and LaCie Storage Partners starting at the suggested retail price of $199.00.<br />

	A recent report from Nielsen shows that folks in the US and UK enjoy using their mobile devices while watching TV, while those in Germany and Italy prefer to do one thing at a time says a report <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57409836-93/more-people-using-tv-and-tablets-at-same-time/">in CNET</a>.</p>
<p>
	Up to 88 percent of US tablet owners and 86 percent of US smartphone owners use their device at least once a month while watching TV. Some (26 percent) use their tablet in front of the TV several times each day. In the UK, the trend mirrors the US with 80 percent of tablet owners and 78 percent of smartphone owners relaxing with their mobile device at least once a month while gazing at the TV. Twenty-four percent admit to using their device while watching TV several times each day.</p>
<p>
	Italy and Germany buck this trend with more than thirty percent of people saying they have never used a tablet while watching TV. When people around the world multitask with their tablet and TV, most people use the tablet to check email or research information about the TV show or movie the they are watching.</p><p style="padding:5px;clear:both;"><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2012/04/05/nielsen-more-people-use-tablets-smartphones-while-watching-tv/">Nielsen: More people use tablets, smartphones while watching TV</a> originally appeared on <a href="http://www.tuaw.com">TUAW - The Unofficial Apple Weblog</a> on Thu, 05 Apr 2012 15:30:00 EST.
